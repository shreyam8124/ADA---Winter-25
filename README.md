The goal of this project is to analyze how customer satisfaction, as reflected in the product reviews from the Amazon Reviews ’23 dataset, changed over the period of COVID-19 when the entire world was on lockdown. The document includes data visualizations to answer the key research questions.
Key research questions
1. How did star ratings change before, during,
and after the COVID-19 pandemic (2018–2023)?
2. Did customer satisfaction trends vary across
product categories during COVID-19, and which categories saw the biggest shifts?
3. How did review characteristics (e.g., length, helpfulness) influence star ratings during the
COVID-19 pandemic?
